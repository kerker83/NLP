## Introduction

**NLP** (Natural Language Processing)<br>
We want to distinguish whether a movie review from IMDB is a positive feedback or a negative feedback by deep learning.<br>
Here, **CNN** (Convolutional Neural Network) is mainly used in this model, and the accuracy of training set is **95.72%**.<br>
But the accuracy of validation set is **87.72%**. That might be **overfitting**.
